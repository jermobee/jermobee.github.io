		<h4 class="title">Paint Sealant</h4>
		<div class="hr dotted clearfix">&nbsp;</div>
			<p><b>We believe that every car should have paint sealant; ....and in a sane world, every car would come ready supplied with a paint sealant!</b></p>
			<p>Paint sealants extend the life of your paintwork by protecting it from UV radiation, road salts, industrial fallout, etching, acid rain and just about anything else which is harmful to paintwork. </p>
			<p>When you think about it, there are so many things that can destroy your paintwork that it's crazy not to apply a paint sealant; especially when you consider that nowadays, cars are mechanically reliable and service intervals have been extended, this means that the value of a car is judged almost solely on cosmetic appearance. This means that protecting your paintwork is protecting your investment. Paint sealants are by far the most effective way of maintaining the value of your car... bike, van, boat, plane, caravan, mobile home.</p>
			<p><b>How do Paint Sealants work?</b></p>
			<p>If you were to look at your paintwork under a microscope, you would see that it isn't smooth, it is full of holes and looks much like a sponge. Every time it rains, the average car will soak up over a pint of water. But just think what else it soaks up! The environment is full of chemicals which are harmful to paintwork, from salts they put on the road in winter, to corrosive and oxidizing compounds deposited by rain. Sealing these holes protects the paintwork and even makes it stronger giving you some degree of protection against stone chips and minor scratches. The tough plastic coating also blocks harmful UV radiation which can bleach the colour from your car.</p>
			<p><b>Benefits of paint protection</b></p>
			<p>If you have bought a new car, then chances are that in 2, 3 or 5 years you will want to sell it or trade it in. Ideally, when that time comes, your car will be as new looking as it is right now, because then you will get the most money for it.</p>
			<p><b>It <i>IS</i> possible to keep your car looking brand new</b></p>
			<p>Keeping your car looking brand new for many years is achievable and for many enthusiasts is a reality. They rinse off their cars every day and keep the wax topped up. Dirt ages a car and attacks paintwork, keeping your car protected with a good coating of wax makes all the difference. Many enthusiasts we know actually keep a bucket and sponge in the boot along with a spray bottle of liquid wax, so that at the first sign of dirt they can deal with it no matter where they are.</p>
			<p>But for most of us who lead busy lives and have other priorities, it isn't practical to wash and wax our cars once a week, let alone three times a week! Although we start off as we mean to go on, the chances are that washing the car will become a chore and this is even truer for waxing. The result is that as time goes on, we will do it less and less often. And as it starts to show that we have done less, we are even less inclined to get out there on a Sunday morning with a bucket and sponge.</p>
			<p><b>How regular do you wax your car?</b></p>
			<p>Recent independent tests carried out in America of all the major brands of retail car wax proved that most natural waxes last no more than four weeks (despite what the manufacturers may claim) This means that by week three, the wax will only be providing minimal protection and will give virtually no resistance against bird muck, tree sap and heavy pollutants. Although synthetic waxes can last far longer (up to 20 weeks), you have to realize that after 10 weeks, the wax will only have half the protection it did when first applied.</p>
			<p><b>Paint sealants differ from waxes</b> in that they amount to a plastic coating which not only lasts longer, but is far more durable to the effects of UV radiation, road salts, industrial fallout, environmental pollution, acid rain, bird muck and tree sap. Although even a paint sealant is not impervious to many of these things, the extra protection means that you have far longer to remove them before permanent damage can occur. This is all you really need to attend to, making sure the car is washed on a regular basis. With the paint sealant resisting the adhesion of dirt, washing your car becomes easy as all you need do is wet, wash and rinse. There is no need for additional polishes and waxes.</p>
			<p><b>Sealants pay you back</b></p>
			<p>The end result is that you have guaranteed paintwork protection for the stated life of your paint sealant. Your car will remain looking new and you have little work to do.</p>
			<p>When the time comes to sell your car, you will know that your paintwork will be in pristine condition, there will be no fading, staining, etching or rust. The higher price your car will command will pay you back every penny you spent on a paint protection package.</p>
			<p>PRICE: CARS -- $110+TX - TRUCKS/VANS/SUV -- $120+TX</p>
